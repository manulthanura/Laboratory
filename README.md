## MATLAB codes for academic lab activities

This repository contains MATLAB codes that are used for academic lab activities. The codes are organized by lab, and each lab has its own README file that provides instructions on how to run the code. The codes are written in a clear and concise manner, and they are well-commented to make them easy to understand. The codes are also tested to ensure that they work correctly.

This repository is a valuable resource for students who are taking MATLAB courses or who are using MATLAB for academic research. The codes can be used to learn how to use MATLAB, to complete lab assignments, and to conduct research.
